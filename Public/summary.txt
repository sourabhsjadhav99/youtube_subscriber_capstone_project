The project is an implementation of a simple Node.js application using Express.js and MongoDB to manage subscriber data. Here's a summary of the key aspects of the project:

1. Folder Structure:
   - MVC (Model view controller) is used to structure project
   - The project follows a typical Node.js application structure with separate directories for models, routes, controllers, and public files.
   - The `models` directory contains the Mongoose schema for the Subscriber model, defining fields such as name, subscribedChannel, and subscribedDate.
   - The `routes` directory includes route handlers for different endpoints related to subscribers.
   - The `controllers` directory contains controller functions that interact with the database and handle business logic.

2. Database Setup:
   - MongoDB is used as the database system, and Mongoose is utilized as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB.
   - A `createDatabase.js` script is provided to create the MongoDB database and populate it with initial subscriber data using Mongoose models.

3. Express Application Setup:
   - The main Express application is structured in `index.js`, where the server is started, and routes are connected.
   - Middleware such as `express.json()` is used for parsing JSON data in requests.
   - Static files are served from the "Public" directory using `express.static()` middleware.

4. Routes and Controllers:
   - The `/subscribers` endpoint is implemented to handle various operations related to subscribers.
   - The `subscriberRoutes.js` file defines routes using the Express Router and connects them to corresponding controller functions in `subscribeControllers.js`.
   - Three main routes are implemented:
     - GET `/subscribers`: Fetches all subscribers from the database.
     - GET `/subscribers/names`: Fetches subscriber names and subscribed channels only.
     - GET `/subscribers/:id`: Fetches a particular subscriber by ID.
     - POST /subscribers: Creates a new subscriber.
     - PUT /subscribers/:id: Updates a subscriber by ID (full update).
     - PATCH /subscribers/:id: Updates a subscriber by ID (partial update).
     - DELETE /subscribers/:id: Deletes a subscriber by ID.

5. Controller Functions:
   - Controller functions in `subscribeControllers.js` handle the business logic for each route.
   - Functions like `getAllSubscribers`, `getSubscriberByName`,`getSubscriberById`, `addSubscriber`, `updateSubscriber`, `patchSubscriber`, `deleteSubscriber` use Mongoose queries to interact with the MongoDB database and format response data.

6. Frontend Interaction:
   - The project includes a basic HTML file (`index.html`) in the "Public" directory for frontend interaction.
   - Users can access different endpoints like fetching all subscribers, fetching names, and fetching subscribers by ID using buttons or input fields on the HTML page.
   - JavaScript functions in the HTML file use Fetch API to communicate with the backend and display response data dynamically.

Overall, the project demonstrates a structured approach to building a Node.js application with Express.js and MongoDB, showcasing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing subscriber data and providing a simple frontend interface for interaction using MVC (Model view controller).
